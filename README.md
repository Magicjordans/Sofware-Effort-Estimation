This report is the exploration of AI for software effort estimation (SEE) through the use of
machine learning (ML). In this report, 5 models are created to retrieve data on past
projects to give estimations on how much effort is required for that given project based
on its attributes (features). The 5 models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree
(DT), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression (LR) will
be optimised using hyperparameters and data will be filtered by using feature selection.
